# 🏥 Deep Healthcare Analysis Using Google BigQuery

## 📖 The Backstory

In a world where data is generated faster than it can be analyzed, the healthcare industry stands at a pivotal crossroads.

Hospitals are flooded not only with patients—but with **data**: patient demographics, diagnoses, treatment records, hospital resource use, and more. While this data holds the potential to transform healthcare delivery, it often remains underutilized.

That’s where this project comes in.

I wanted to answer a simple but powerful question:

**"What can healthcare data tell us if we just ask the right questions—at scale?"**

So, I turned to **Google BigQuery**, one of the fastest and most powerful data warehousing platforms available, to dig deep into a healthcare dataset and uncover insights that can drive better decisions and smarter strategies in the medical world.


## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a full-scale data analysis pipeline using:

- ✅ **Google BigQuery** for querying large datasets in the cloud  
- ✅ **Python** (via Jupyter Notebook) for data manipulation and visualization  
- ✅ **Pandas & Matplotlib/Seaborn** for storytelling through data

The notebook connects directly to a public healthcare dataset hosted on BigQuery, processes millions of records efficiently, and transforms raw healthcare statistics into actionable insights.

## 🔍 What I Explored

Using real hospital-level data, I explored key questions such as:

- **Which hospital departments handle the most patients?**
- **What age group is most frequently admitted?**
- **How do types of admission (Emergency, Routine, etc.) affect hospital resource use?**
- **Is there a correlation between the severity of illness and the duration of hospital stay?**
- **Which states or regions have the highest admission rates?**

Each query ran live in BigQuery, then results were analyzed and visualized in Python. The blend of **cloud-scale querying** and **local storytelling** brought the data to life.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies

 Tool               | Purpose                            
 **Google BigQuery** | Large-scale SQL querying            
 **Python**          | Programming & data handling         
 **Pandas**          | Data wrangling                     
 **Matplotlib/Seaborn** | Data visualization              
 **Jupyter Notebook** | Interactive development & EDA     

## 📈 Key Insights

- The **Age Group 31-50** showed the highest admission frequency.
- **Emergency admissions** were more likely to be associated with **higher severity illnesses** and longer hospital stays.
- Certain **medical departments** consistently handled more complex cases.
- **Regional disparities** in patient admissions hinted at broader access-to-care challenges.
